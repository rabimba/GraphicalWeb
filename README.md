## Keynote at GraphicalWeb 2016 on State of WebVR, Aframe with Demo

This is the presentation presented at GraphicalWeb 2016 at Mets Office, Exeter.

### NOTES

You need to run it form a server for the slides to work properly. This is an interactive slide. So the audio demo and others need user interaction to be effective.

If you plan to use it and need support, just open an issue.

### caveats

The voice controlled demo requires the slide to be run form Google Chrome to access the speech api. If you use the experimental chromium build for webvr. You will need to define the speech api key form Google in the browser for it to work.
